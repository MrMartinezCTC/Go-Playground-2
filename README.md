## Golang Playground Template

This repository serves as a template for experimenting with the Go programming language. Use it as a playground to learn, test, and play with Go code.
Getting Started

To run the default Go file (main.go), follow these steps:

Open the Go file in your code editor.

Right-click on the main.go file and select "Open in Integrated Terminal".

In the terminal, run the following command:

```
go run main.go 
```

Replace main.go with the name of your Go file if it's different.

Happy coding!
